## Installation

The module can be installed via [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) or simply [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/).

Run `pip3 install python-gedcom` to install or `pip3 install python-gedcom --upgrade`
to upgrade to the newest version uploaded to the [PyPI repository](https://pypi.org/project/python-gedcom/).

.. tip::
   Using [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) simplifies the installation and maintenance of dependencies.

### Pre-releases

If you want to use the latest pre-release of the `python-gedcom` package,
simply append the `--pre` option to `pip3`: `pip3 install python-gedcom --pre`

## Important classes and modules

* `gedcom.parser.Parser`: The actual GEDCOM parser.
* `gedcom.tags`: GEDCOM tags like `gedcom.tags.GEDCOM_TAG_INDIVIDUAL` (`INDI`) or `gedcom.tags.GEDCOM_TAG_NAME` (`NAME`)
* `gedcom.element`: Contains all relevant elements generated by a `gedcom.parser.Parser`.

## Example usage

When successfully installed you may import the `gedcom` package and use it like so:

```python
from gedcom.element.individual import IndividualElement
from gedcom.parser import Parser

# Path to your ".ged" file
file_path = ''

# Initialize the parser
gedcom_parser = Parser()

# Parse your file
gedcom_parser.parse_file(file_path)

root_child_elements = gedcom_parser.get_root_child_elements()

# Iterate through all root child elements
for element in root_child_elements:

    # Is the "element" an actual "IndividualElement"? (Allows usage of extra functions such as "surname_match" and "get_name".)
    if isinstance(element, IndividualElement):

        # Get all individuals whose surname matches "Doe"
        if element.surname_match('Doe'):

            # Unpack the name tuple
            (first, last) = element.get_name()

            # Print the first and last name of the found individual
            print(first + " " + last)
```

.. tip::
   Please have a look at the test files found in the 
   [`tests/` directory in the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/nickreynke/python-gedcom/tree/master/tests).

## Strict parsing

Large sites like Ancestry and MyHeritage (among others) don't always produce perfectly formatted GEDCOM files.
If you encounter errors in parsing, you might consider disabling strict parsing which is enabled by default:

```python
from gedcom.parser import Parser

file_path = '' # Path to your `.ged` file

gedcom_parser = Parser()
gedcom_parser.parse_file(file_path, False) # Disable strict parsing
```

Disabling strict parsing will allow the parser to gracefully handle the following quirks:

- Multi-line fields that don't use `CONC` or `CONT`
- Handle the last line not ending in a CRLF (`\r\n`)
