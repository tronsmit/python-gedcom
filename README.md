A Python module for parsing, analyzing, and manipulating GEDCOM files.

GEDCOM files contain ancestry data. The parser is currently supporting
the GEDCOM 5.5 format which is detailed here: http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pmcbride/gedcom/55gctoc.htm

> **NOTE**: This module is currently under development. The current development
> process can be tracked in the ["develop" branch](https://github.com/reynke/python-gedcom/tree/develop).

## Installation

The module can be installed via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/).

Run `pip install python-gedcom` to install or `pip install python-gedcom --upgrade`
to upgrade to the newest version uploaded to the [PyPI repository](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-gedcom).

## Usage

When successfully installed you may import the `gedcom` module and use
it like so:

```python
from gedcom import *

file_path = '' # Path to your `.ged` file
gedcom = Gedcom(file_path)

# Then run methods on `gedcom` ... :)
```

## History

This module was originally based on a GEDCOM parser written by 
Daniel Zappala at Brigham Young University (copyright (C) 2005) which
was licensed under the GPL v2 and then continued by
[Mad Price Ball](https://github.com/madprime) in 2012.
