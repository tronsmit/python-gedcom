A Python module for parsing, analyzing, and manipulating GEDCOM files.

GEDCOM files contain ancestry data. The parser is currently supporting
the GEDCOM 5.5 format which is detailed [here](https://chronoplexsoftware.com/gedcomvalidator/gedcom/gedcom-5.5.pdf).

> **NOTE**: This module is currently under development and **should not be used in production**!
> The current development process can be tracked in the ["develop" branch](https://github.com/reynke/python-gedcom/tree/develop).

## Installation

> **NOTE**: As of the 26 march of 2018 the beta of the new Python Package
> Index launched. I recommend reading this: "[All New PyPI is now in beta](https://pyfound.blogspot.de/2018/03/warehouse-all-new-pypi-is-now-in-beta.html)"

The module can be installed via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/).

Run `pip install python-gedcom` to install or `pip install python-gedcom --upgrade`
to upgrade to the newest version uploaded to the [PyPI repository](https://pypi.org/project/python-gedcom/).

## Usage

When successfully installed you may import the `gedcom` module and use
it like so:

```python
from gedcom import Gedcom

file_path = '' # Path to your `.ged` file
gedcom = Gedcom(file_path)
```

Iterate through all records, search last names and print matches

```python
all_records = gedcom.get_root_child_elements()
for record in all_records:
    if record.is_individual():
        (first, last) = record.get_name()
        if last == 'Brodie':
            print(first + " " + last)
```

## Quirk Handling

Some genealogical websites like MyHeritage and Ancestry produce GEDCOM files that are somewhat out of spec.  This module aims to handle these quirks.  Specifically that includes:

- Ignoring BOM control characters
- Multi-line fields that don't use CONC or CONT
- Handle the last line not ending in a CRLF

## History

This module was originally based on a GEDCOM parser written by 
Daniel Zappala at Brigham Young University (Copyright (C) 2005) which
was licensed under the GPL v2 and then continued by
[Mad Price Ball](https://github.com/madprime) in 2012.

Further updates by [Nicklas Reincke](https://github.com/nickreynke) and [Damon Brodie](https://github.com/nomadyow) in 2018.
