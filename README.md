## Changelog

For the latest changes please have a look at the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file.

The current development process can be tracked in the [develop branch](https://github.com/nickreynke/python-gedcom/tree/develop).

## Local development

Local development is done using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and
[pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) using Python 3.8.

### Running tests

1. Run `pipenv install -d` to install normal and dev dependencies
1. Run tests with [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (`pipenv run tox` in your console)
    * For Python 3.5 run `pipenv run tox -e py35` (you need to have Python 3.5 installed)
    * For Python 3.6 run `pipenv run tox -e py36` (you need to have Python 3.6 installed)
    * For Python 3.7 run `pipenv run tox -e py37` (you need to have Python 3.7 installed)
    * For Python 3.8 run `pipenv run tox -e py38` (you need to have Python 3.8 installed)

### Generating docs

1. Run `pipenv install -d` to install normal and dev dependencies
1. Run `pipenv run pdoc3 --html -o docs/ gedcom --force` to generate docs into the `docs/` directory

> To develop docs run `pipenv run pdoc3 --http localhost:8000 gedcom`
> to watch files and instantly see changes in your browser under http://localhost:8000.

### Uploading a new package to PyPI

1. Run `pipenv install -d` to install normal and dev dependencies
1. Run `pipenv run python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` to generate distribution archives
1. Run `pipenv run twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*` to upload the archives to the Test Python Package Index repository

> When the package is ready to be published to the real Python Package Index
the `repository-url` is `https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/`.
>
> `pipenv run twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*`

## History

This module was originally based on a GEDCOM parser written by 
Daniel Zappala at Brigham Young University (Copyright (C) 2005) which
was licensed under the GPL v2 and then continued by
[Mad Price Ball](https://github.com/madprime) in 2012.

The project was taken over by [Nicklas Reincke](https://github.com/nickreynke) in 2018.
Together with [Damon Brodie](https://github.com/nomadyow) a lot of changes were made and the parser was optimized.
