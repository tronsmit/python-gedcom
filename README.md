## About this Fork

This is a personal fork of [`python-gedcom`](https://github.com/nickreynke/python-gedcom), by Nicklas Reincke and contributors. My intention is to adapt and extend this library for use in custom GEDCOM-based genealogy applications.

The original README with full documentation and packaging instructions has been archived [here](README.original.md).

## History

This module was originally based on a GEDCOM parser written by  
Daniel Zappala at Brigham Young University (Copyright (C) 2005) which  
was licensed under the GPL v2 and then continued by  
[Mad Price Ball](https://github.com/madprime) in 2012.

The project was taken over by [Nicklas Reincke](https://github.com/nickreynke) in 2018.  
Together with [Damon Brodie](https://github.com/nomadyow), a lot of changes were made and the parser was optimized.
